Implementation of sorting algorithms using Java.

The file contains 4 text files with different sizes of arrays and sorting algorithms are used to sort them and display the time taken by the algorithm to sort the different array files.

Implemented sorting algorithms:
1. Insertion Sort
2. Merge Sort
3. Quick Sort

Used filed handling to read the text files and System.nanoTime to calculate the time taken by the algorithm.

This is one of the assignment given by the professor.
